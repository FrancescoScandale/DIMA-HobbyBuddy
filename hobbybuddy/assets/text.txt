Once you've figured out which foot you need in front of your board, let's start to push your skateboard. Put your foot (facing forward) over the front truck bolts (knees bent) and use the other foot to give a little push, go easy and don't step on your skateboard.

You need to practice this a few times first.

Next, put your other foot on the deck and position your front foot sideways, turning your foot will help you keep your balance. So basically how you ride a skateboard is like this:

- Put your front foot over the front truck bolts of your board.
- Push with your other foot.
- Push with your back foot and place it on your tail.
- Position your from foot sideways.
- Keep doing this until you feel comfortable, it could take a couple of days/weeks before you feel in control depending on how much you practice. If you don't feel comfortable after practicing many times, you might want to try to put your other foot in front. Just take your board to school, work or your friend's house to get familiar with riding a skateboard.

Like anything in life, you'll need practice before you master a new skill.
Don't get overconfident once you think you have everything under control. Leave the ollies and kickflips for now. The next thing you want is to learn how to turn.
