# HobbyBuddy
This is a mobile application developed for the course "Design and Implementation of Mobile Applications", in collaboration with Marta Radaelli. \
This is a demo application, whose main goal is to practice Flutter development. \
The idea behind the app is to allow users to select any number of favourite hobbies and be able to see on a map where courses for those hobbies are held (in the area around the address provided during signup). There is also the possibility to add friends and check their profile: user profiles are able to store milestones, i.e. posts where users can post pictures with captions about their hobbies. \
For further details, refer to the **Design Document**.

## Running the application
Open the simulator of your choice and run, from the "hobbybuddy" directory: <br>
flutter run <br>
<br>
A profile can then be created.

### Note
Courses are only present in Milan, so look around there when looking for courses in the map!
